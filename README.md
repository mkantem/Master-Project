# Master-Project
This project will develop an Eclipse plugin for performing transformations (based on an algebraic approach) on graphs expressed as EMF model 
>#### Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) 
Platform that use Eclipse facilities to provide a powerful tool and manipulation of models and automatic generation of appropriate modeling environments in specific areas.
#### _Graph_ 
A transformation on it involve .....
>>#### _Graph Grammar_
A graph grammar provides a mechanism wherein the transformations
local on a graph can be modeled in a mathematically
precise way. This grammar is mainly a finite set of
productions; production is generally a triplet (M, D, E) where M and D
(Mother & Daughter) are graphs and E is a set
mechanism (rules) connection.
